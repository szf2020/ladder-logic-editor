## BOOL Tests

### Basic Operations
- [x] TRUE literal evaluates to true
- [x] FALSE literal evaluates to false
- [x] Variable assignment works
- [x] Comparison (= and <>) works

### Coercion
- [x] BOOL to INT: TRUE=1, FALSE=0 (tested via conditional logic)
- [x] INT to BOOL: 0=FALSE, non-zero=TRUE (tested via conditional logic)
- [x] BOOL in arithmetic context (counting with BOOL conditions)

---

## INT Tests

### Range and Bounds
- [x] Minimum value: -32768 (tested in bounds.test.ts, data-types.test.ts)
- [x] Maximum value: 32767 (tested in bounds.test.ts, data-types.test.ts)
- [x] Overflow behavior: 32767 + 1 = 32768 (JavaScript number, no overflow)
  - Note: JS has no 16-bit int overflow, documented behavior
- [x] Underflow behavior: -32768 - 1 = -32769 (JavaScript number)

### Arithmetic
- [x] Addition
- [x] Subtraction (including negative results)
- [x] Multiplication (including negative operands)
- [x] Division (truncates toward zero, including negative results)
- [x] MOD (remainder, all sign combinations tested)
- [x] Division by zero behavior (tested in error-handling.test.ts)

### Comparison
- [x] Equal (=)
- [x] Not equal (<>)
- [x] Less than (<)
- [x] Greater than (>)
- [x] Less or equal (<=)
- [x] Greater or equal (>=)
- [x] Comparison with 0 (was buggy, now fixed)

### Literals
- [x] Decimal: 42
- [x] Negative: -42
- [x] Zero: 0
- [ ] Hexadecimal: 16#FF (parser support needed)
- [ ] Binary: 2#1010 (parser support needed)
- [ ] Octal: 8#77 (parser support needed)

## REAL Tests

### Range and Precision
- [x] Positive values (tested with 3.14159, 2.718, etc.)
- [x] Negative values (tested with -2.718, -1.0, etc.)
- [x] Very small values (near zero, tested with 0.0001)
- [x] Very large values (tested with 1.0E38)
- [x] Infinity handling (tested in error-handling.test.ts)
- [x] NaN handling (0.0/0.0 → NaN, NaN=NaN is FALSE per IEEE 754)

### Arithmetic
- [x] Addition (1.5 + 2.6 = 4.1)
- [x] Subtraction (5.5 - 2.3 = 3.2)
- [x] Multiplication (2.5 * 3.0 = 7.5)
- [x] Division (7.5 / 2.0 = 3.75)
- [x] Division by zero → Infinity (tested)

### Comparison
- [x] Equality: 3.14 = 3.14 (exact, per standard)
- [x] Less than: 2.5 < 3.5
- [x] Greater than: 3.5 > 2.5
- [x] Near-zero comparisons (tested in bounds.test.ts)
- [x] 0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3 (IEEE 754 precision documented in bounds.test.ts)

### Coercion
- [ ] REAL to INT (truncation)
- [ ] INT to REAL (exact for small values)

### Literals
- [x] Decimal: 3.14
- [ ] Scientific: 1.5E-10
- [ ] Negative exponent: 2.0E-5

---

## TIME Tests

### Parsing
- [x] T#100ms (milliseconds)
- [x] T#1s (seconds)
- [x] T#1m (minutes)
- [x] T#1h (hours)
- [x] T#1d (days) - 86400000ms
- [x] T#1m30s (compound)
- [x] T#1h30m45s500ms (full compound) - 5445500ms

### Arithmetic
- [ ] TIME + TIME
- [ ] TIME - TIME
- [ ] TIME * INT (scaling)
- [ ] TIME / INT (scaling)

### Comparison
- [x] TIME = TIME
- [x] TIME < TIME (500ms < 1s)
- [x] TIME > TIME (2s > 1s)

### Edge Cases
- [x] T#0ms (zero time) - parses to 0
- [ ] Negative time (invalid?) - parser rejects
- [x] Very large time (T#24h) - 86400000ms, no overflow
- [ ] Overflow in addition - TIME arithmetic not implemented

## Type Coercion Matrix

| From \ To | BOOL | INT | REAL | TIME |
|-----------|------|-----|------|------|
| BOOL | - | 0/1 | 0.0/1.0 | ❌ |
| INT | !=0 | - | exact | T#Xms |
| REAL | !=0 | trunc | - | ❌ |
| TIME | ❌ | ms | ❌ | - |

### Coercion Tests
- [ ] Implicit coercion in mixed expressions
- [ ] Explicit coercion functions (if any)
- [ ] Invalid coercions produce error

---

## Property-Based Tests

```typescript
// Integer properties
fc.assert(fc.property(
  fc.integer({ min: -32768, max: 32767 }),
  (n) => {
    // Value round-trips through assignment
    // Stays within range
  }
));

// Real precision
fc.assert(fc.property(
  fc.double({ min: -1e10, max: 1e10 }),
  (n) => {
    // Reasonable precision maintained
  }
));
```
