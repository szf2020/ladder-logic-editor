## Current Task: Implement the IEC_61131_3_REFERENCE

Implement the spec in our interpreter.

Implementation status is tracked in specs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
Choose ogical amount of work to complete. Ensure the write tests -> build implementation -> pass tests loop is followed
Choose property and unit tests as are appropriate

### Important
- Follow the spec closely - it has detailed component implementations
- Commit after each phase or logical chunk of work
- Log any approaches that don't work in GUARDRAILS.md
- Given you're in a loop, make a logical amount of progress per iteration
- Only report RALPH_DONE when all phases are complete, and there are no workarounds or skipped tests left

Commit and push before finishing.
