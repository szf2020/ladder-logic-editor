## Current Task: Documentation & Onboarding Implementation

Implement the documentation and onboarding system as specified in DOCUMENTATION_SPEC.md.

Implementation Phases are in the specs/DOCUMENTATION_SPEC.md
### Important
- Follow the spec closely - it has detailed component implementations
- Ensure onboarding is non-intrusive (doesn't block UI interactions)
- localStorage key: `lle-onboarding-state`
- Commit after each phase or logical chunk of work
- Log any approaches that don't work in GUARDRAILS.md
- Given you're in a loop, make a logical amount of progress per iteration
- Only report RALPH_DONE when all phases are complete, and there are no workarounds or skipped tests left
